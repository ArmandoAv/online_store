# online_store

This project is to create a model of an online store.

It was done with two different databases, so there is a folder for each database used. Inside each folder is a readme file with instructions for creating the model and data sets.

There is also a folder called pip which contains a Python script that helps install the pip tool, within the other folders are the instructions to use that file.
